- implement spectators

- prevent nominating dead chancellor (backend doesn't prevent this)
- when game is over, show hitler to everyone
- when game is over, show player factions to everyone
- check game rules about who(m) is allowed what information about who(m) wrt factions
- check game rules: is hitler always unknown to all others?

- bug: when hitler is killed, the 'execute player' window pops up again

- [future]instead of broadcasting the full game state after every move just update what's needed
- log events that occur in each round (+ track who shoudl receive the info), this should make it easier to build the UI 'event' view
