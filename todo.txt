- implement spectators
- rebuild the policy deck from discarded policies if there are fewer than 3 cards left
- show the elegible policies to the president and the chancellor when voting
- tons of ui improvements (hide/disable buttons that are not available)
- instead of broadcasting the full game state after every move just update what's needed
